## Instructions

Run the index.html file from the folder. Start the game to start the counter. Find all matching cards to win the game.
Every two clicks count as one move. The more clicks you make the lesser stars you get.

###Dependencies

The game runs with various components:

- [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/?from=io) - The icons used for the cards.
- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) - the animations used when cards are a match or not. When using the CDN option if the 3.7.0 version does not work, try the previous one.
- [Sweetalert](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/) - Used to generate the modal when game board is complete.
